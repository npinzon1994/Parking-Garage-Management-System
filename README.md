## Special Notes

-All data saves and loads automatically.

-Handicapped Space feature coming soon!

-The parking garage has three levels. Each level can hold four different vehicle sizes:
 Motorcycle, Compact Car, Mid-size Car, and Trucks/Vans/SUVs. Each level currently holds 20 parking spots,
 5 for each different vehicle type. The lots were originally intended to hold 125 spots per level, but were down-sized for quicker testing. The size of the lots can easily be changed by changing the sizes of each respective array.
 
 -The parking lots are set to be times in seconds, even though the combo box items in the Pane4Create.java class are all labelled by hour. This application is intended to charge patrons by an hourly rate. The hours were changed to seconds so the person testing the program can see the payment calculations quickly in real-time. 
 
 ### When viewing parked cars or available spaces, please DO NOT scroll using the trackpad. This may cause the application to crash because Java throws a strange exception. However, scrolling works perfectly fine when just clicking and dragging the scroll bar like normal.
